## Installation

Using Python 3 (will probably not work using Python 2), run `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies.

## GUI

To run GUI, run `python3 gui.py`.

## Scripts

`proj1.py` contains the bulk of the code.  My python ports of Pade, Prony,
Shanks, and convm are also included.
